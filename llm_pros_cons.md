> Last updated: 2025-08-10

## Mistral‑NeMo‑12B (12B)
**Link:** https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Mistral-NeMo-12B-Instruct  
**Alt (Base):** https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Mistral-NeMo-12B-Base

**Pros**
- Permissive Apache 2.0 license.
- Large context window (up to 128k) and strong code/multilingual skills for its size.
- Comes in both Base and Instruct; easy to fine‑tune; widely quantized.

**Cons**
- Heavier than 7B models; needs more VRAM for full‑precision use.
- Smaller finetune ecosystem than Llama/Qwen families.
- Reasoning is good but generally trails specialized reasoning models (e.g., R1‑distill).

## Qwen2.5‑7B
**Link (Base):** https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B  
**Link (Instruct):** https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct  
**GGUF:** https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GGUF

**Pros**
- Apache 2.0 license; easy commercial use.
- Strong instruction following and multilingual coverage for its size.
- Mature local‑inference ecosystem (GGUF/AWQ, tool use examples).

**Cons**
- Smaller parameter count limits deep reasoning vs larger (≥14B) models.
- Output can be verbose without careful prompting.
- Not as strong at deliberate “step‑by‑step” reasoning as R1‑distilled models.

## Qwen3‑8B
**Link (Base):** https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-8B-Base  
**Link (General):** https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-8B  
**GGUF:** https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-8B-GGUF

**Pros**
- Newer generation with improved reasoning/instruction following.
- Good multilingual support; broad set of checkpoints and quantizations.
- Strong performance per parameter; active development cadence.

**Cons**
- Slightly heavier than 7B models; higher memory/latency.
- Ecosystem and prompts are still in flux as Qwen3 matures.
- Some older Qwen2.x tooling/snippets may need updates.

## Llama 3.1‑8B
**Link:** https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B

**Pros**
- High‑quality instruction‑tuned checkpoints; strong general chat.
- Huge ecosystem support across libraries, serving stacks, and hardware.
- Good multilingual capabilities for an 8B model.

**Cons**
- Licensed under the Llama 3.1 Community License (not OSI “open‑source”).
- Heavier than 7B peers for local use; best results often need GPU.
- Fewer permissive redistribution rights vs Apache/MIT models.

## Phi‑4‑14B
**Link (Base):** https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-4  
**Link (Reasoning‑tuned):** https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-4-reasoning

**Pros**
- MIT license; friendly for research and commercial use.
- Strong math/coding and general reasoning for a 14B dense model.
- Widely available via Hugging Face and Azure model catalogs.

**Cons**
- English‑first; multilingual performance is limited compared to Qwen/Llama.
- 14B parameters require more memory than 7–8B class models.
- Smaller third‑party finetune ecosystem than Llama/Qwen.

## DeepSeek‑R1‑Distill‑Qwen‑14B
**Link:** https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B

**Pros**
- MIT license; strong deliberate reasoning distilled from DeepSeek‑R1.
- Excellent chain‑of‑thought style performance for its size; many quantized variants.
- Active community and clear usage recommendations for “reasoning‑first” prompts.

**Cons**
- Can produce long “thinking” traces; may need prompt constraints.
- Heavier VRAM needs vs 7–8B models; latency higher.
- More sensitive to decoding settings; outputs can repeat if sampling is mis‑tuned.

## Quick pick guide
- **Fast local chat on modest GPUs/CPUs:** Qwen2.5‑7B, Qwen3‑8B (GGUF).  
- **Permissive license & strong generalist:** Mistral‑NeMo‑12B, Phi‑4‑14B.  
- **Best small(ish) reasoning:** DeepSeek‑R1‑Distill‑Qwen‑14B.  
- **Broadest ecosystem & frameworks:** Llama 3.1‑8B.
